                            <p class="card-text">Issue Now is an in-school organsation dedicated to raising money for good causes.
                                Each year we get together to organise and run fundraisers for a variety of charities.
                                We do bakesales, bucket-shaking and collect food for foodbanks as well as many other things.
                                Run by S6s, we welcome anyone who would like to join and we meet at Monday lunchtime in M1.33.

                                                This also means that many popular ways of fundraising are impossible, but we would like to encourage you to donate to charities and be kind.
                                                Foodbanks in particular are in need of donations as always and you can see the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/EdinFoodProject/">Edinburgh Food Project's Facebook page</a> for details on how you can help.</p>

                                                We have started a partnership with <a href="https://lilypads.org.uk/" title="Lilypads Website">Lilypads</a> - an Edinburgh based organisation dedicated to giving all women access to sanitary products and ending period poverty.
                                                Period poverty is a worldwide problem, with 10% of girls and women in the UK unable to afford period products. 
                                                Lilypads works to provide afforable products to girls and women across the UK and Kenya so that no girl has to miss work or school because of their period. 
                                                They also run workshops to reduce the stigma around periods and educate girls.

                                            <p class="card-text">
                                                Through our partnership, we hope to reduce stigma around periods, make sure no one at our school is without access to period products and rasining money to help other women in need.
                                                We recently put on a play <i>A Feminine Ending</i> to raise money for Lilypads.
